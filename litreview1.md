# Literature Review 1 Tatham and event-stream


For the first literature assignment please read Simon Tatham's [How to report bugs effectively](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html)

If you'd like, you may restrict your literature review strictly to Tatham's 
piece.

That said, for a look at a more current, but specific topic, please take a look through this GitHub issue:

https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116

You don't have to read every last one of the comments in issue #116 but can 
also take a look at the following to get a bit of a tl;dr:

https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/hacker-backdoors-widely-used-open-source-software-to-steal-bitcoin/

https://lwn.net/Articles/773121/

You can comment, at your option, on this topic instead of, or in addition 
to, the Tatham piece.

Please make a blog post with the [litreview criteria](litreview) in mind.
