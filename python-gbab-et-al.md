One use to which you can put a [Python virtual environment](python-environments) is to run a community architecture 
analysis using **Git by a bus** or similar tools.

### Run Git By A Bus on a trial project

Follow the instructions included in the "Git By A Bus" repository on Github
to generate a report on your selected project, available here:

[Git by a bus version 2](https://github.com/tomheon/git_by_a_bus/tree/v2) (More powerful but output is raw. Run it as gbab.py)

or, alternately:

[Git by a truck](https://github.com/ryansb/gitbyatruck)

or any newer forks of the above.

[Git by a lion](https://github.com/liam-middlebrook/git_by_a_lion) might be 
useful for generating presentations from GBAB v2.

You may wish first to run GBAB on itself, or on another small trial project
like
