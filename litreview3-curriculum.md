For the third literature review assignment, you are to read about 4th grade math learning standards and identify which concepts you wish to pursue in developing your final project for HFOSS.

First, please consult pages 3 through 7 in the introduction to the New York state Common Core Learning Standards for 
[K12 Math](http://hfoss17s-ritjoe.rhcloud.com/static/decks/nysp12cclsmath.pdf) to see how to read the standards.

Then, read this version of the New York State Common Core Learning Standards
for [Grade 4 Math](http://hfoss17s-ritjoe.rhcloud.com/static/hw/litreview.txt).  


Then, write a variation of [a literature review blog post](http://hfoss17s-ritjoe.rhcloud.com/static/hw/litreview.txt) in which you identify what particular fourth grade learning objectives or subject matter interests you the most.

Optionally, you may also wish to consult standards in the 
[full K12 math document](http://hfoss17s-ritjoe.rhcloud.com/static/decks/nysp12cclsmath.pdf)
for grade 3 (page 20) and grade 5 (page 28) to provide further context for comparison, or to consult the 
[4th grade](http://hfoss17s-ritjoe.rhcloud.com/static/decks/MA-0111-grade4only.pdf) and
[K12](http://hfoss17s-ritjoe.rhcloud.com/static/decks/MA-0111.pdf) Massachusetts standards.
