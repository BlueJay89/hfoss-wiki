## CommArch Presentation 30 pts

Your presentations should last 5-10 minutes with another 3-5 minutes for discussion.

Your team will need to present from the front of the room. You can either:

  1) Make your slides web-accessible, or
  2) Email slides as a .pdf to your instructor.

Every member of your team needs to speak for a roughly equal amount of
the presentation. Be prepared.

  * What stumbling blocks were there? What successes?
  * What would you have done differently?
  * What would you have worked on if you'd had more time?

Your Presentation will be graded on aspects such as:**

  *   Presentation Skills (Projection, Posture, Body Language)
  *   Grammar/Spelling
  *   Design (colorschemes, graphics, look/feel)
  *   Timing (significantly over/under time limit)
  *   Content (quality/quantity of information)
  *   Adherence to Guidelines (Did you hit all the bullet points in this list?)
