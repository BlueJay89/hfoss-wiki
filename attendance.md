# Attendance & general participation

Attendance is mandatory. Unexecused absences accrue a loss of points & a penalty of 5% off the total grade 
(deductions stop accruing at a C).

You have 3 excused absences (one week's worth) with no 5% penalty
Excused means we made prior arrangement or you were sick, communicated this to me, and I acknowledge it.

For each class period, I expect you to get the full 4 points/day by being present and by participating.

Deficiencies in attendance may be scored thus:

 * Remote presence only (for inperson class): 75% for day, no other penalty.
 * Present in class, but slacking (late, inattentive): 75% for day, no other penalty.
 * Absent, unexcused, but you tell me ahead; very late; habitually late or unattentive: 50% for day, possible 5% off total grade.
 * Absent, but you tell me afterward: 25% for day, possible 5% off total grade.
 * No show, no email/IRC: 0% for day and 5% off total grade.
