# Humanitarianism overview

We've talked a lot about FOSS and a little bit of the history and some of
the ideas around it, and we will continue to cover that side of things, but
we haven't explored very much the humanitarian side of the course. We've
looked at Sugar and mentioned some of its educational purpose, but only in
passing. I'd like to zoom out on the humanitarian aspect of the course and
take a broad look at what we mean by 'humanitarian'.

What do we mean by **humanitarian** or **humanitarianism**. 

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism)

In the simplest terms, promoting human welfare or seeking to meet human
needs.

This often focuses on basics: 

  * immediate needs like
    * food
    * clothing
    * shelter 
    * acute medical assistance
  * it can include longer-term basics
    * education
    * spiritual support
    * counseling 
    * mental health

Humanitarian work can be applied in acute situations, such as emergency relief
or support for needs during a crisis, but it can also include longer-term
projects in capacity building.

Some examples of common local entitites that might be involved in providing
humanitarian support include: schools, churches, local first responders like
emergency medical technicians (EMT).


Other terms and concepts common in discussion of humanitarian work include **foundations**, **charity**, **philanthropy**, **volunteering**, **fundraising**, **donations**, non-governmental organizations (**NGO**), quasi-NGO (**QUANGO**).

[Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/) provides some measures as to how well a charity effectively uses its resources, as a guide to donors.
