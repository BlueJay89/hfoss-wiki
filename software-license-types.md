## Rights, restrictions, and licensing: Software licenses

We consider software licensing to fall into three broad categories:

  * copyleft
  * permissive or non-reciprocal
  * proprietary


Opinions vary widely about what makes a good, or even an acceptable, license 
choice. One school of thought takes a very live-and-let-live approach, "your code, your 
license" and considers it bad form to complain about the licenses others 
choose. Another (eg, the FSF) considers proprietary licensing an ethical 
hazard the use of which creates an unjust dependency of users on the 
creators of software.

Copyleft can and will be used with, or even incorporate permissively licensed works (FSF, SFC, SPI)

Some permissive licensing advocates reject proprietary and copyleft works alike (ASF, BSDs)

Proprietary can accept permissively licensed works.

Some permissive licensing advocates reject copyleft *but* tolerate proprietary 
incorporation of permissively licensed work.

There's a split within copyleft camp about the importance of pursuing copyleft 
enforcement.

Some types of copyleft can conflict: ZFS under CDDL which (at least by some 
analysis) conflicts with GPL of Linux kernel.
