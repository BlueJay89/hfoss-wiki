# HFOSS Grading Policies Spring 2018

## Attendance & general participation

Attendance is mandatory. Unexecused absences accrue a loss of points & a penalty of 5% off the total grade.

See the attendance page for details.

## Blogs

### Frequency

You should write at least one blog post a week. 

Longer posts, or additional posts, will describe your graded work and constitute part of submitting that work for evaluation.


#### Length guidelines


 * at least 250 words per topic
 * no more than 1000 words per week

I'll try not to fuss too much about length. Quality, rather than quantity, is what I'm after.

#### Blog rubric

  * 2 points for not too long/short
  * 1 points for grammar, spelling, formatting
  * 2 points for having citations or external links
  * 3 points for being HFOSS related, obvious or explained
  * 2 points for compelling content 

  *  substantive
  *  good observation or comparison
  *  makes an argument
  *  avoids [fallacies](fallacies)

Can make weekly blog post and assignment posts at one time, but must submit the link for each (eg, blog5, smoketest2) 

Project proposals also are written up as blog posts. Again, you can double them up, but must send a PR for each link separately.

## Due dates

Due dates will **generally** be on **Wednesdays**, one hour before the start of class. 

There is an **early bonus** deadline: Any assignment made before Sunday before the Wednesday due date can be handed in that Sunday night by 8pm for a bonus.

The bonus is 5% of the assignment total, rounded up to the nearest whole point.

There is a **late penalty**, assessed per business day for any day or part of a business day the assignment is late.

So, for a Wednesday due date, any time after 8am is one day. Any time Thursday is another. The weekend will count for Friday up through 8pm Sunday (catching up late homework is more important than getting a bonus for subsequent assignments).

The late penalty is 5% of the assignment point total, rounded up to the nearest point. This means that being late on smaller assignments may cost more than 5%. For example, if blog posts are worth 15 points each, each point off per day is 6.6%. 

Being late will not cost more than 50% of the grade so long as something is turned in before it's too late to grade (see absolute deadlines below). So, for a high value assignment, you will hit 50% off after 10 business days or two weeks. For a low value assignment for which lateness accrues more quickly, eg, a 15 point blog post, you'll hit 50% after just 7 business days.

Any assignment at least 10 business days late by the start of the drop-with-a-W date, Apr 6, will get a zero. After that, any assignment more than 10 business days late not handed in by the last day of classes will get a zero. Any assignment not handed in by the start of the scheduled final exam period will get a zero.

I will endeavor to offer some form of feedback often, and more formal feedback in terms of grades every 3 weeks, or about 5 times during the semester.

## Quizzes

  * low risk but real feedback
  * usually pop quizzes done in-class using firstflight methods.

## Literature review

see litreview.txt

  * rubric similar to blog post
  * more constrained and substantive (higher points) than blog post
  * Give reference
    * URL plus ...
    * [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) link (find it or make it)
    * [DOI](https://www.doi.org/) if applicable

You can do up to one (1) additional litrev for **extra credit** (EC). Article must be approved by instructor beforehand.

The [FLOSS papers](https://flosshub.org/biblio) collection would be a good source for EC litreviews. Since these papers are already abstracted (an academic paper abstract is very similar in scope, length and function to a blog post) you will need to add your own twist to the paper, in your own words, perhaps by applying the concepts from the paper to new examples.

## Bugfix

One of your assignments will be to submit a bug fix.

Accepted additional bugfixes count for EC, no limit.

## Pull request format

Please submit your PRs from feature branches with names indicating the nature of the submission, according to the following examples:
