    For example:

    A) 1618                       a) War of 1812
    B) 1776                       b) Second Defenestration of Prague
    C) 1812                       c) United States' Declaration of Independence

    becomes

    A) 1618                       a) Second Defenestration of Prague
    B) 1776                       b) United States' Declaration of Independence
    C) 1812                       c) War of 1812


7\) We've discussed "the four R's" as a shorthand for the freedoms
attached to software for it to be considered "free" or "open source".
List or describe each. (eg, if you can remember the "r" word you can
just give that. If you cannot remember the term, but can describe the
freedom involved, that also counts). Various "r" words are roughly
synonymous for some of the freedoms, but we're counting freedoms here,
not synonyms so if you give two (or more) terms for the same freedom, it
only counts once. For the purposes of this quiz, "remix" does not count
as describing any of them. (1pt each)

-   10.1)

-   10.3)
-   10.4)
