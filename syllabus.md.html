<h2 id="text-books">Text Books</h2>
<p>There are a number of textbooks we’ll be referencing throughout the<br />
semester. They will be added to <a href="/oer">the resources page</a><br />
or in the <a href="https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss-library">library</a> for your use.</p>
<p>Purchase of a textbook is not required.</p>
<p><a name="what-you-ll-do"></a></p>
<h2 id="what-youll-do">What You’ll Do</h2>
<p>This course will introduce students to the Free and Open Source Software<br />
(FOSS) and Open Content movements, to the open source development<br />
process, and to the open questions of the efficacy of technology in the<br />
classroom.</p>
<p>Students will learn FOSS process and Tools with class projects that support<br />
the <a href="https://www.sugarlabs.org">SugarLabs</a> community (or other humanitarian projects) by creating<br />
content and software for free distribution to students and teachers around<br />
the world. The SugarLabs project is driven by a world-wide community–one of<br />
which successful students in HFOSS will become a part.</p>
<p><a name="the-spirit-of-the-course"></a></p>
<h2 id="the-spirit-of-the-course">The spirit of the course</h2>
<p>While still a course where you will receive a letter grade, the spirit<br />
of the course is intended to be both open and fun.</p>
<p>An open course – students will have access to the ‘document source’ for<br />
the syllabus. As a student of the class you have a right to <a href="http://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss">fork the upstream repositories</a><br />
for this syllabus and other course content (<a href="https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss-library">library</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/wiki">wiki</a>), make modifications, and<br />
submit patches for review. Barring a troll festival, this can create a<br />
fun, dynamic environment in which the course curriculum can develop by<br />
the very same mechanism being taught during the semester<br />
(community-driven).</p>
<p><a name="licensing"></a></p>
<h2 id="licensing">Licensing</h2>
<p>All code developed by students in the course must be licensed (by the<br />
student) under any one of the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/category">licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative</a></p>
<p>Code that you write is <strong>your</strong> code, with which you can do what you<br />
will; true. However, if you’re unwilling to license code you write for<br />
an Free/Open Source course with a Free/Open Source license, you may be<br />
in the wrong course.</p>
<p>Similarly, the essence of this course entails your doing significant<br />
collaborative work in public, the results of which will remain public.<br />
If you do not wish to make your work public in this way, please contact<br />
the instructor during the first week of class to make other arrangements.</p>

hosted anywhere, but must be added to the course <a href="http://hfoss.rocfoss.org/participants">participant page</a> (there are instructions on how to do this in<br />
<a href="https://github.com/ritjoe/hfoss/wiki/firstflight"><strong>First Flight</strong></a>). All blog posts are<br />
syndicated to the blog aggregator <a href="https://people.rit.edu/djaigm/planet/hfoss/">HFOSS Planet</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You must make at least one blog post per week (up to 12) to receive full credit.<br />
You must participate regularly in the course’s IRC channel: asking and<br />
answering questions.<br />
Contributions to the course curriculum, syllabus, and rubric are<br />
factored in here as well.</p>

<h2 id="lightning-talks---extra-credit">Lightning Talks - Extra Credit</h2>
<p>Every Friday for the first portion of class, any student has the<br />
opportunity to give a <code>lightning talk</code> on a topic of their chosing. Your<br />
lightning talk must be less than 5 minutes in length and must be at<br />
least remotely related to the course material.</p>
<p>All students will do at least one lightning talk. You will receive +10<br />
extra credit points towards your final grade for every subsequent lightning<br />
talk you give. Only the first <strong>2</strong> lightning talks offered will be allowed<br />
during a given class. Talks will be chosen from among those offered by<br />
students on a <code>FIFO</code> basis.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fix---extra-credit">Bug Fix - Extra Credit</h2>
<p>You can earn extra credit by successfully fixing a bug in a FOSS<br />
project.</p>
<p>You will receive extra credit points towards your final grade for<br />
every pull request accepted by an independently-maintained project<br />
against a pre-existing bug (eg, fixing new bugs you found, or even<br />
generated don't count!).</p>
<p>Send an <a href="email:deejoe@mail.rit.edu">email to the instructor</a> with<br />
sufficient detail to confirm your bug fix was accepted.</p>
