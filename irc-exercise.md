# HFOSS Exercise: Initial IRC Experience 


## Get connected

Go to [the course web page](http://hfoss.rocfoss.org) and choose the Instant
IRC link from the header (wide screen) or hamburger menu (narrow screen).

Enter your nickname and then navigate past the CAPTCHA.


## Find your way round the web client

Note the menu in the upper left. Next to it, see a list of tabs leading to
different main windows. Below the tab bar is the channel name and the
channel topic. In some clients the topic scrolls offscreen but can be
recalled with the `/topic` command.

Along the right-hand side is a list of `nicks` for each client connected to
the channel.

Along the bottom is a text entry area. This is where you'll compose your
messages to the channel and where you'll issue commands to the client (eg,
`/help` )


## Complete these tasks

**Before the end of class**, say something in the channel. If you care to, you
can identify yourself by name, email address, GitHub account, or otherwise.
If you'd prefer to reserve those for a private message or for a direct
email, that's ok too.


**Before the next class**, register your nick with nickserv, join the channel,
authenticate your connection with nickserv and send a private message (aka a **pm**) to the
instructor of the form:

`/msg dzho` *my email address is **deejoe@mail.rit.edu** and my GitHub account is **ritjoe***


Just be sure to include your own information in place of the **bold items**
above.
